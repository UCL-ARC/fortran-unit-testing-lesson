##Â Experienced Fortran Developer who is new to unit testing

- Has lots of experience writing Fortran (possibly new to Fortran types).
- Does not currently write unit tests in Fortran (might be experienced with writing tests in other languages).
- What they don't know
    - How to write tests in Fortran.
    - How to use Fortran types.
    - How to integrate tests into build system.
    - Good practice for writing unit tests.
    - How to write testable code.
- Mental models
    - Procedures are not always separate neat units. They are often full features which would be very difficult to unit test.
    - Fortran in a very functional language without the use of types.
    - Global state is necessary for Fortran code.
- Motivation
    - They wish to add unit testing into their own code bases but don't know how to.
    - They have heard of unit testing but don't know what it is or how it applies to their Fortran code

## Experienced Developer who is new to Fortran

- New to Fortran but can understand the syntax.
- Regularly writes unit tests in other languages such as python.
- Expects to work on Fortran in the Future and wants to know how to test their code.
- What they don't know
    - How to write tests in Fortran.
    - How to use Fortran types.
    - How to integrate tests into build system.
    - How to build Fortran code.
    - How to manage packages, compilers, etc for compiled code such as Fortran.
- Mental models
    - Pytest style unit tests.
        - *Draw on parallels of Fortran test tools and pytest.*
- Motivation
    - They wish to add unit testing into Fortran code bases they are starting to collaborate on.
    - They want to understand how unit testing in Fortran is done, compared to languages such as python.
