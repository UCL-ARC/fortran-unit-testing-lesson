:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How do we go from **.pf** files to an executable test?
- How do we identify which test is failing and where?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Be able to add a new test to our existing Make and CMake build system.
- Understand where we name our tests within the build system.
- Diagnose a failing test and find the cause.

## Integrating pFUnit with Make

Let's look at the steps required to add pFUnit tests to a project built using Make.
Firstly, assume we have the following file structure.

```
|-- ROOT_DIR/
    | Makefile
    |-- src/
    |   |-- main.f90
    |   |-- something.f90
    |      
    |-- tests/
        |-- Makefile
        |-- test_something.pf
        |-- test_something_else.pf
```

The top level **Makefile** is responsible for compiling the src code but
should do very little regarding building the tests. However, it should...

- Export relevant variables for the **tests/Makefile** to pick up.
  ```
  export SRC_BUILD_DIR
  export ROOT_DIR
  export SRC_OBJS
  export FC
  export FC_FLAGS
  export LIBS
  ```
- Define targets which pass through to targets in the **tests/Makefile**.
  ```
  tests: $(SRC_OBJS)
  	@echo "Building pFUnit test suite..."
  	@$(MAKE) -C $(TEST_DIR) tests

  clean:
  	rm -rf $(BUILD_DIR)
  	$(MAKE) -C $(TEST_DIR) clean
  ```

::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler

#### Full file

The full top level **Makefile** may look something like this...

```
# Top level variables
ROOT_DIR = $(shell dirname $(realpath $(firstword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))))
FC ?= gfortran
FC_FLAGS = #... Some flags required for compilation
LIBS = #... Some libs to link to

#------------------------------------#
#      Targets for compiling src     #
#------------------------------------#
SRC_DIR = $(ROOT_DIR)/src
BUILD_DIR = $(ROOT_DIR)/build

# List src files
SRC_FILES = \
    something.f90 \
    main.f90

# Map src files to .o files
SRC_OBJS = $(patsubst %.f90, $(BUILD_DIR)/%.o, $(SRC_FILES))

# Build src .o files
$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o: $(SRC_DIR)/%.f90 | $(BUILD_DIR)
	@echo "Building $@"
	$(FC) -c -J $(BUILD_DIR) -o $@ $<

# Build src executable
$(BUILD_DIR)/a.exe: $(SRC_OBJS)
	$(FC) -o $@ $(FC_FLAGS) $^ $(LIBS) 

# Map exe target to building executable
exe: $(BUILD_DIR)/a.exe

# Ensure the build dirs exists
$(BUILD_DIR):
	mkdir -p $@

#------------------------------------#
#         Targets for testing        #
#------------------------------------#
TEST_DIR = $(ROOT_DIR)/tests

# Include make command from tests Makefile
tests: $(SRC_OBJS)
	@echo "Building pFUnit test suite..."
	@$(MAKE) -C $(TEST_DIR) tests


#------------------------------------#
#        Targets for cleaning        #
#------------------------------------#
# Define target for cleaning the build dir
clean:
	rm -rf $(BUILD_DIR)
	$(MAKE) -C $(TEST_DIR) clean

.PHONY: clean

#--------------------------------------#
# Export variables for child Makefiles #
#--------------------------------------#
# Export variables for the other Makefiles to use
export BUILD_DIR
export ROOT_DIR
export SRC_OBJS
export FC
export FC_FLAGS
export LIBS
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The **tests/Makefile** would then look like this...

```
PFUNIT_INCLUDE_DIR ?= $(ROOT_DIR)/../pfunit/build/installed/PFUNIT-4.12/include

# Don't try to include if we're cleaning as this doesn't depend on pFUnit
ifneq ($(MAKECMDGOALS),clean)
include $(PFUNIT_INCLUDE_DIR)/PFUNIT.mk
TEST_FLAGS = -I$(BUILD_DIR) $(FC_FLAGS) $(LIBS) $(PFUNIT_EXTRA_FFLAGS)
endif

# Define variables to be picked up by make_pfunit_test
tests_TESTS = \
  test_something.pf \
  test_something_else.pf
tests_OTHER_SOURCES = $(filter-out $(BUILD_DIR)/main.o, $(SRC_OBJS))
tests_OTHER_LIBRARIES = $(TEST_FLAGS)

# Triggers pre-processing and defines rule for building test executable
$(eval $(call make_pfunit_test,tests))

# Converts pre-processed test files into objects ready for building of the executable
%.o: %.F90
	$(FC) -c $(TEST_FLAGS) $<

clean:
	\rm -f *.o *.mod *.F90 *.inc tests
```

**Key points:**

- We must include the pre-installed pFUnit dependencies and Makefile options via the **PFUNIT.mk** file.
  - The version of pFUnit that has been built will affect the path to this file (i.e. **.../installed/PFUNIT-4.15/include/...**)
- We are utilising the function provided by pFUnit **make_pfunit_test**
  - This will create a target of the provided name (in this case **tests**)
  - We define the variables pFUnit requires to build the **tests** target as variables prefixed with **tests_**.
    - **tests_TESTS** - A list of the **.pf** test files to be pre-processed before compilation.
    - **tests_OTHER_SOURCES** - A list of src object files required for the tests (excluding the src main/program file)
    - **tests_OTHER_LIBRARIES** - A list of library flags to pass to the compiler when compiling the test code
- We must create a target for compiling object files which uses the same flags as **tests_OTHER_LIBRARIES**

We can then build and run our tests with the following commands

```sh
make tests
./build/tests
```

## Integrating pFUnit with CMake

Let's now look at the steps required to add pFUnit tests to a project built using
CMake. Similar to before, let's assume we have the following file structure.

```
|-- ROOT_DIR/
    | CMakeLists.txt
    |-- src/
    |   |-- main.f90
    |   |__ ... Some module files containing src code
    |      
    |-- tests/
        |-- CMakeLists.txt
        |-- test_something.pf
        |-- test_something_else.pf
```

Just like with Make, the top level **CMakeLists.txt** file is responsible for
compiling the src code but should do very little regarding building the tests.
However, it should...

- Define a variable which stores a list of src files
  ```cmake
  set(SRC_DIR "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src")
  set(PROJ_SRC_FILES 
    "${SRC_DIR}/main.f90"
    "${SRC_DIR}/something.f90"
  )
  ```
- Enable testing.
  ```cmake
  enable_testing()
  ```
- Add the **tests/** dir as a subdirectory.
  ```cmake
  add_subdirectory("tests")
  ```

::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler

#### Full file

The full top level **CMakeLists.txt** may look something like this...

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9 FATAL_ERROR)

# Set project name
project(
  "something_interesting"
  LANGUAGES "Fortran"
  VERSION "0.0.1"
  DESCRIPTION "Doing something"
)

# Define a variable which stores a list of src files
set(SRC_DIR "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src")
set(PROJ_SRC_FILES 
  "${SRC_DIR}/main.f90"
  "${SRC_DIR}/something.f90"
)

# Build src executables
add_executable("${PROJECT_NAME}" "${PROJ_SRC_FILES}")

# Enable testing.
enable_testing()

# Add the tests dir as a subdirectory.
add_subdirectory("tests")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The **tests/CMakeLists.txt** file would then look like this...

```cmake
find_package(PFUNIT REQUIRED)

# Filter out the main.f90 file. We can only have one main() function in our tests
set(PROJ_SRC_FILES_EXEC_MAIN ${PROJ_SRC_FILES})
list(FILTER PROJ_SRC_FILES_EXEC_MAIN EXCLUDE REGEX ".*main.f90")

# Create library for src code
add_library (SUT STATIC ${PROJ_SRC_FILES_EXEC_MAIN})

# List all test files
set(test_srcs
  "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/tests/test_something.pf"
  "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/tests/test_something_else.pf"
)

# Add the test target
add_pfunit_ctest (test_something_interesting
  TEST_SOURCES ${test_srcs}
  LINK_LIBRARIES SUT # your application library
  )
```

**Key points:**

- First, we find the pFUnit package to ensure the required libraries and cmake
  functions are available
- We then filter the **main.f90** program file from the list of src files.
- We store the src files in a library (**SUT**, stands for system under test)
  to be referenced later.
- We list the test **.pf** files we wish to include within **test_srcs**.
- We then create a test with pFUnit and CTest using the function provided by
  pFUnit, **add_pfunit_ctest**. Here we are...
    - naming the test **test_something_interesting**.
    - informing pFUnit of the relevant src files via **TEST_SOURCES**.
    - linking to the src library via **LINK_LIBRARIES**.

### Building with CMake

We can then build our tests with the following commands

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/pfunit/build/installed
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build # or ./build/tests/test_something_interesting
```

:::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Mixing CTest and pFUnit

In this case we have called **add_pfunit_ctest** once with all of our **.pf**
test files. This results in there being one CTest test (i.e. one executable
**./build/tests/test_something**) which runs all tests. However, it may be
preferable to call **add_pfunit_ctest** more than once, thus creating multiple
executables to further divide up your tests. 

Note that the tests can still be filtered by calling the executable itself and
using pFUnit's inbuilt filtering option, like so.

```sh
$ ./build/tests/test_something_interesting -f test_something_else -v
 

 Start: <test_something_else_suite.TestMySrcProcedure>
.   end: <test_something_else_suite.TestMySrcProcedure>

Time:         0.001 seconds
  
 OK
 (1 test)
```
