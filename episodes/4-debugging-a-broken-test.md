:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How do I know if my tests are failing?
- How do I fix a failing tests?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- [ ] Can build and edit the provided repo for the walkthrough.
    - *Assessment:* Following the build instructions successfully builds the code.
    - *Assessment:* Following the instructions successfully runs the pre-existing tests.
- [ ] Capable of determining where in the tests or src code the failure is occurring.
    - *Assessment:* Starting from a failing test, find the failing test-suite/module/procedure/line
- [ ] Can fix a failing test.
    - *Assessment:* Starting from a failing test, update the code so the test passes
- [ ] Understand where a test is defined in the build system (CMake and FPM).
    - *Assessment:* Add a new test to the build system
    - *Assessment:* Update the name of a test in the build system
    - *Assessment:* Enabled and fix a disabled test which is broken.
- [ ] Understand the failure output of a Fortran unit test written in...
    - *Assessment:* Starting from a failing test, update the code so the test passes

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

#### Challenge 1: Run the tests.

Take a look at [4-debugging-a-broken-test/challenge-1](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/fortran-unit-testing-exercises/episodes/4-debugging-a-broken-test/challenge-1) in the exercises repository.

Try and run the tests? Are they all passing? He's a hint, they're not. Which one(s) are failing?
