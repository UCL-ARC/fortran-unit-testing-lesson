  This lesson aims to teach the basics of writing unit tests in Fortran
  using a set of available frameworks - pFUnit, test-drive and veggies.
  The lesson will cover the basics of unit testing, how to identify and
  write testable Fortran code, how to write the unit tests for both
  serial and parallel Fortran in all three frameworks and how to
  integrate these tests into a Fortran project using both CMake and FPM
  build systems.

  This lesson is aimed at learners who already understand the basics of
  programming in Fortran and wish to start increasing the maintainability
  of their code with the addition of unit tests.
